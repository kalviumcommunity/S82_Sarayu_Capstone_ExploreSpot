# Explore Spot - A Community-Driven Travel Platform

## Project Idea
 Explore Spot is a platform where travelers can share their experiences, upload photos, and rate places they visit. Users looking for travel inspiration can search for specific locations or browse all shared experiences. The platform will also feature personalized recommendations based on seasons and real-time weather. Additionally, businesses (restaurants, hotels, tour guides) can promote themselves to travelers, making it a comprehensive travel discovery hub.
